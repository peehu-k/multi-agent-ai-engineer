Autonomous Multi-Agent AI Software Engineer

Self-Improving System for Autonomous Code Generation, Evaluation, and Tool Building

⸻

Overview

This repository presents a fully autonomous multi-agent artificial intelligence system capable of generating, debugging, evaluating, optimizing, and evolving production-ready Python tools from natural language instructions.

The system simulates a real-world AI software engineering workflow in which multiple specialized agents collaborate to design, implement, review, and improve software tools while continuously learning from performance and past builds.

A real-time dashboard provides visibility into system intelligence, performance benchmarks, tool ecosystem growth, and execution activity.

This project demonstrates the practical design of self-improving AI engineering systems and autonomous development pipelines.

⸻

Objectives
	•	Build an autonomous multi-agent AI engineering system
	•	Enable self-improving code generation and tool creation
	•	Implement persistent intelligence and learning memory
	•	Benchmark system performance across engineering tasks
	•	Visualize real-time AI activity and system evolution
	•	Simulate production-style AI software engineering workflows

⸻

System Architecture

The system operates as a coordinated multi-agent pipeline:

User Task → Architect → Coder → Debugger → Reviewer → Tool Builder → Intelligence Engine → Learning System

Each agent performs a specialized role within the autonomous development lifecycle.

⸻

Core Components

Architect Agent

Designs structured engineering workflows and decomposes complex tasks into executable modules.

Coder Agent

Generates complete runnable Python tools using local large language models and structured prompts.

Debugger Agent

Improves robustness and correctness of generated code through automated debugging and optimization.

Reviewer Agent

Evaluates code quality using a numerical scoring system to ensure production-level standards.

Tool Builder

Stores successful tools into a persistent reusable ecosystem for future reuse and improvement.

Tool Reuse Engine

Detects similarity with previously built tools and reuses or improves existing implementations instead of rebuilding.

Self-Improvement Engine

Identifies weaker tools and autonomously upgrades them to improve system capability over time.

Benchmark Engine

Evaluates system performance across multiple engineering tasks and records:
	•	Success rate
	•	Average quality score
	•	Build time
	•	System intelligence growth

Intelligence Tracking System

Maintains persistent metrics including:
	•	Total runs
	•	Successful builds
	•	Failed builds
	•	Tools created
	•	Intelligence score evolution

⸻

Dashboard and Visualization

A professional Streamlit dashboard provides real-time system visibility:
	•	Live multi-agent activity feed
	•	Intelligence growth tracking
	•	Tool ecosystem overview
	•	Benchmark performance graphs
	•	Success rate and quality metrics
	•	Real-time task execution monitoring

This enables complete transparency into system behavior and learning progression.
