# Autonomous Multi-Agent AI Software Engineer

**Self-Improving System for Autonomous Code Generation, Evaluation & Tool Building**

---

## Overview

This repository presents a fully autonomous multi-agent artificial intelligence system capable of generating, debugging, evaluating, optimizing, and evolving production-ready Python tools from natural language instructions.

The system simulates a real-world AI software engineering workflow where multiple specialized agents collaborate to design, implement, review, and improve software tools while continuously learning from performance and previous builds.

A real-time dashboard provides visibility into system intelligence, benchmark performance, tool ecosystem growth, and execution activity.

This project demonstrates the practical design of self-improving AI engineering systems and autonomous development pipelines.

---

## Objectives

- Build an autonomous multi-agent AI engineering system
- Enable self-improving code generation and tool creation
- Implement persistent intelligence and learning memory
- Benchmark system performance across engineering tasks
- Visualize real-time AI activity and system evolution
- Simulate production-grade AI software engineering workflows

---

## System Architecture

The system operates as a coordinated multi-agent pipeline:

**User Task → Architect → Coder → Debugger → Reviewer → Tool Builder → Intelligence Engine → Learning System**

Each agent performs a specialized role within the autonomous development lifecycle.

---

## Core Components

### Architect Agent
Designs structured engineering workflows and decomposes complex tasks into executable modules.

### Coder Agent
Generates complete runnable Python tools using local language models and structured prompts.

### Debugger Agent
Improves robustness and correctness of generated code through automated debugging and optimization.

### Reviewer Agent
Evaluates code quality using a numerical scoring system to ensure production-level standards.

### Tool Builder
Stores successful tools into a persistent reusable ecosystem for future reuse and improvement.

### Tool Reuse Engine
Detects similarity with previously built tools and reuses or improves existing implementations instead of rebuilding.

### Self-Improvement Engine
Identifies weaker tools and autonomously upgrades them to improve system capability over time.

### Benchmark Engine
Evaluates system performance across engineering tasks and records:
- Success rate
- Average quality score
- Build time
- Intelligence growth

### Intelligence Tracking System
Maintains persistent metrics including:
- Total runs
- Successful builds
- Failed builds
- Tools created
- Intelligence score evolution

## Dashboard & Visualization

A professional Streamlit dashboard provides real-time system visibility:

- Live multi-agent activity feed
- Intelligence growth tracking
- Tool ecosystem overview
- Benchmark performance graphs
- Success rate and quality metrics
- Real-time task execution monitoring

This enables complete transparency into system behavior and learning progression.
